Today Date(29/12/2023) I will be solving some basic pattern printing in Python.

PROBLEM 1:
Problem Name :SEEDING

Problem statement
Sam is planting trees on the upper half region (separated by the left diagonal) of the square shared field.

For every value of ‘N’, print the field if the trees are represented by ‘*’.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
* * *
* *
*
Sample Input 2 :
1
Sample Output 2 :
*
Sample Input 3 :
4
Sample Output 3 :
* * * *
* * *
* *
*

Solution:

def seeding(n: int) -> None:
    # Write your solution here.
    for i in range(n,0,-1):
        for j in range(i):
            print('* ',end="")
        print('\n',end="")

PROBLEM 2:

Problem Name : Reverse Number Triangle

Problem statement
Aryan and his friends are very fond of the pattern. For a given integer ‘N’, they want to make the Reverse N-Number Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

1 2 3
1 2
1
Sample Input 1:
3
Sample Output 1:
1 2 3
1 2
1
Sample Input 2 :
4
Sample Output 2 :
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
Sample Input 3 :
7
Sample Output 3 :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1

Solution:
def nNumberTriangle(n: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n,0,-1):
        for j in range(i):
            print(str(j+1)+" ",end="")
        print('\n',end="")

PROBLEM 3:

Problem Name: Star Triangle
Problem statement
Ninja was very fond of patterns. For a given integer ‘N’, he wants to make the N-Star Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output:

Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
The first row contains two spaces, followed by a star.
The second row contains one space, followed by three stars.
The third row contains five stars.
Sample Input 2 :
1
Sample Output 2 :

Solution:
def nStarTriangle(n: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            print(" ",end="")
        for k in range(2*i+1):
            print("*",end="")
        for l in range(n-i+1):
            print(" ",end="")
        print('\n',end="")


PROBLEM 4:

Problem Name:Reverse Start Triangle

Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
The first row contains five stars.
The second row contains one space, followed by three stars.
The third row contains two spaces, followed by a star.
Sample Input 2 :

Solution:
def nStarTriangle(n: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            print(" ",end="")
        for j in range(2*(n-i)-1):
            print("*",end="")
        print('\n',end="")
