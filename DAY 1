Pattern problems 
Today Date(28/12/2023) I will be solving some basic pattern printing in Python.

PROBLEM 1:

Problem Name : N-Forest
Problem statement
Sam is making a forest visualizer. An N-dimensional forest is represented by the pattern of size NxN filled with ‘*’.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N-dimensional forest.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
* * *
* * *
* * *
Sample Input 2 :
1
Sample Output 2 :
*
Sample Input 3 :
4
Sample Output 3 :
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *

Solution :
def nForest(n:int) ->None:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print('* ',end="")
        print('\n',end="")





PROBLEM 2:
Problem Name: N/2-Forest
Problem statement
Sam is making a forest visualizer. An N-dimensional forest is represented by the pattern of size NxN filled with ‘*’.

An N/2-dimensional forest is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with ‘*’.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N/2-dimensional forest.

Example:
Input:  ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
* 
* *
* * *
Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
For N = 3, fill all the rows and columns in the lower triangle of 3x3 matrix with ‘*’.
Sample Input 2 :
1
Sample Output 2 :
* 

Solution:
def nForest(n: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1):
            print('* ', end="")
        print('\n', end="")



PROBLEM 3:
Problem Name : N-Triangles
Problem statement
Sam is making a Triangular painting for a maths project.

An N-dimensional Triangle is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with integers starting from 1.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N-dimensional Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
1
1 2 
1 2 3
Sample Input 2 :
1
Sample Output 2 :
1

Solution:
def nTriangle(n: int) ->None:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1):
            print(str(j+1)+' ',end='')
        print('\n',end='')


PROBLEM 4:
Problem Name: Triangle pattern
Problem statement
Sam is making a Triangular painting for a maths project.

An N-dimensional Triangle is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with integers representing the row number.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
1
2 2 
3 3 3
Sample Input 2 :
1
Sample Output 2 :
1

Solution:
def triangle( n:int) ->None:
    # Write your solution here.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1):
            print(str(i+1)+' ',end="")
        print('\n',end="")
    pass
